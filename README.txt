to run the code properly, check the Search value code in the script to the name of the team you want
this search value works for any specific string and will take the values of the team that first has that string in its data
this works even if you only type in part of the teams full name but not abbreviations

The two text scripts included in the file should be linked to text soruces in OBS by hitting "read from file" then linking the files to the source

then feel free to modify and adjust the text however you like in obs.
